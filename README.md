# SublimeF9

Textual comparison for Sublime Text 4 between the view with input focus and the
view, that previously had input focus. The comparison starts at each view's
current cursor position, or alternatively, at the end of its selection. The next
difference which is found is indicated by advancing the cursor or selection to
the found difference. White space (spaces, tabs, carriage returns) are ignored
during comparison.
